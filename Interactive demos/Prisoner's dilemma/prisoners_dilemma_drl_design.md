# Technical Design Document: Interactive Prisoner's Dilemma with DRL Agents

## Overview

This interactive demo will showcase multi-agent reinforcement learning principles through the classic Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). The objective is to provide an engaging, educational experience illustrating strategic interactions, emergent behaviors, and equilibrium concepts using AI-driven agents.

## Goals
- Visually demonstrate strategic interactions in PD using DRL agents.
- Allow users to interact by adjusting game parameters to observe resulting agent strategies.
- Clearly illustrate fundamental game-theoretic concepts: Nash Equilibria, cooperation, defection, repeated games dynamics, and adaptive learning.

## Functional Requirements

### User Experience
- Interactive web-based interface (Streamlit or React-based UI).
- Clear, intuitive visualization of game interactions and outcomes.
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Reward/Penalty values (Temptation, Reward, Punishment, Sucker's payoff).
  - Number of rounds (single vs repeated).
  - Learning parameters (exploration rate, discount factor, learning rate).

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Users select from predefined scenarios or customize parameters.
- AI agents engage in repeated rounds of PD, making strategic choices (cooperate/defect).
- Real-time visualization of agent decisions, cumulative rewards, and evolving strategies.
- Dynamic explanation panel providing insights into strategic behavior, highlighting game theory concepts such as Tit-for-Tat, mutual defection equilibrium, cooperation emergence, etc.

## Technical Architecture

### Front-end (Interactive UI)
- React or Streamlit (rapid prototyping).
- Visualization library: D3.js or Plotly for dynamic, animated graphs.

### Back-end (Simulation Engine)
- Python-based DRL implementation (e.g., Stable-Baselines3, Ray RLlib, PyTorch).
- REST API or direct integration via Streamlit for seamless communication with front-end.

### DRL Implementation Details
- Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network (MADQN) or Multi-Agent PPO.
- Agents: Represent individual "prisoners" learning through repeated PD interactions.
- State: History of recent moves, cumulative scores, opponent behaviors.
- Action: Binary (cooperate, defect).
- Reward: Payoffs according to the PD matrix.

## Game Theoretic Components
- Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | Cooperate | Defect |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Cooperate**       | R, R      | S, T   |
| **Defect**          | T, S      | P, P   |

Where T > R > P > S and typically 2R > (T + S).

- Example Initial Setup:
  - Temptation (T): 5 points
  - Reward (R): 3 points
  - Punishment (P): 1 point
  - Sucker's payoff (S): 0 points

- Exploration of strategies:
  - Nash Equilibrium (Defection, Defection)
  - Cooperative strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
  - Evolution of cooperation under repeated interactions

## Visualization and UI Elements
- Interactive matrix visualization updating live decisions.
- Real-time reward progression graphs.
- Strategy heatmaps illustrating agent policy convergence.
- Interactive sliders/buttons for parameter manipulation.
- Explanation cards highlighting key outcomes and learnings.

## Data Logging and Analytics
- Capture historical gameplay data for real-time analytics.
- Provide downloadable results and agent policy snapshots.
- Enable playback functionality for past simulations.

## Deployment Considerations
- Hosted as lightweight web application (Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces).
- Optimized for low-latency interaction to ensure engaging user experience.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Slow model convergence affecting user experience.
  - **Mitigation:** Pre-train agent policies offline for instant gameplay responsiveness.

- **Risk:** UI complexity reducing accessibility.
  - **Mitigation:** User-testing with early prototypes for iterative UX improvement.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional social dilemmas (Public Goods, Ultimatum game).
- Extend to larger multi-agent scenarios to visualize emergent collective behaviors.
- Integration with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to deepen educational impact.
