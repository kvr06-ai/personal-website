## About Me & Research

I am a scientist with nearly a decade of experience in the tech industry, including four years at Amazon where I developed production-level statistical and time series forecasting models that impacted billions of dollars in advertising revenue. I am seeking to join a productive research group that focuses on applying (deep) reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to build multi-agent systems. My research interests center around applying game-theoretic principles, such as mechanism design, and neuroeconomic principles, such as neural and computational aspects of decision making, to create more efficient and adaptive agent interactions.
